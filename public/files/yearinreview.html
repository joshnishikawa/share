      Tatsuno's Approach to English Instruction in Elementary School
    </span>
    <p class="deets">
      This is an attempt to summarize Tatsuno's approach to teaching English in
      elementary school. The information is based on my experience over the past
      year in the position of an ALT and my conversations with other ALTs,
      teachers, members of the Tatsuno Board of Education and parents. Although I'll be
      speaking English, the target audience includes all of them and anyone else
      with an interest in the subject. Any leaking opinions are mine alone.

    <div id="city_c" class="accordion-collapse collapse bg-white border shadow p-3" style="cursor:pointer;"
      aria-labelledby="city_h" data-bs-parent="#main_a">
      <p class="deets">
        First of all, I should discuss Tatsuno's approach to teaching English in
        relation to my understanding of how some other cities handle it.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Each city has its own overall approach to teaching English in Elementary school.
          <p class="deets">
            Some cities have English specialists who are responsible for teaching
            English to 3rd through 6th grades. Some cities have any combination of
            homeroom teachers, English specialists or English teachers from Jr. high
            schools come to teach English in elementary schools. This depends on
            location, number of students and availability of staff.
          </p>
          <p class="deets">
            Some cities hire enough ALTs to join each class each week. Other cities
            only hire enough ALTs to join each class once or twice a month.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          There are different ALT agencies for cities to choose from.
          <p class="deets">
            Each agency has its own hiring standards, employment benefits and training
            procedures. But, generally, the 'ALT' position is considered a temporary
            position. This inevitably has some effect on how seriously their role is
            taken. More on this very complicated aspect a bit later.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          Different cities have different working relationships with their ALT agencies.
          <p class="deets">
            Although the English curriculum is determined by the prefecture, cities that
            rely more heavily on ALTs may also rely on their respective agencies for
            providing lesson plans and teacher training. Some cities also ask ALTs to
            take on a more active role in the classroom than others. There are even
            cities that are considering foregoing the ALT position altogether and
            hiring native English speakers to teach English lessons assisted by the
            homeroom teachers.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>


      <details>
        <summary>As for Tatsuno...</summary>
        <p>
          The city of Tatsuno covers a large area with schools of all sizes. So the
          teaching situations vary quite a bit. Generally, 3rd and 4th grade homeroom
          teachers lead English lessons once a week with the ALT assisting each time.
          5th and 6th grade classes have English lessons twice a week; The first lesson
          is taught either by an English specialist or the homeroom teacher alone.
          The second is taught by the same person assisted by an ALT.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agency that trains and provides ALTs for Tatsuno also facilitates
          training sessions for teachers. These sessions are voluntary for homeroom
          teachers. However, English specialists are required to attend these sessions
          periodically as well as other training sessions facilitated by the
          prefecture. This is a balanced and relatively progressive approach.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Every student can interact with a native English speaker at least once a week.
          </li>
          <li>
            Homeroom teachers for 3rd and 4th grade make great English speaking role
            models for their students.
          </li>
          <li>
            Older students get some English instruction exclusively with a Japanese teacher.
            <p class="deets">Many students need certain things explained thoroughly as
              well as opportunities to ask questions without the pressure of being
              expected to use language they're not comfortable with yet.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, they have a second lesson to practice what they've learned.
            <p class="deets">This has the potential to be very productive and fun. It's
              also really important to give the students confidence and enthusiasm
              before they enter the junior high school English program.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="deets">
          It was done a bit differently last year and will be done a bit differently
          next year as Tatsuno pushes to unify the curriculum between elementary and jr.
          high school.

      <p class="deets">
        Even within the same city, English instruction differs between schools. There

          <p>
            Each school has a different number of classes in each grade and alltogether.
            For large schools, planning lessons may be delegated.
          </p>
          <p class="deets">
            I worked at a large school this year with either five or six classes in
            each grade. For 3rd and 4th grades, it would be impractical to meet with
            each of 12 homeroom teachers to discuss what to do in class. Instead, one
            of the homeroom teachers in each grade made the lesson plan for all
            teachers in that grade. This is how we kept all classes on the same page.
            However, there are a few problems built in to this approach.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Most teachers follow a lesson plan written by someone else.
              <p class="deets">
                The teacher who actually makes the lesson plan with the ALT knows
                exactly what to do and when. Other teachers receive a copy of
                the lesson plan but may not understand exactly how to proceed or where
                they are needed to explain or help demonstrate. Even if it is made
                clear, there may be several days before the plan is used in the
                classroom. It's also easy to overlook things that need to be prepared
                before class.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              It's difficult to refine the lesson plan because it's already written.
              <p class="deets">
                The ALT gains valuable experience each time they teach the lesson and
                may find something that needs more clarification or a more fun way to
                do something. And there isn't often an opportunity to communicate this
                to the next teacher(s) but doing things off-script may create
                confusion.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              The scheduling and rescheduling of lessons can get very chaotic.
              <p class="deets">
                The schedule in Elementary school can be very unpredictable - even more
                so with more classes. Different classes in the same grade are often at
                different points in the curriculum. This makes it a bit harder to keep
                track of what each class needs to be doing.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>There are several smaller schools in Tatsuno which face a different set
            of challenges.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The ALT may only be at the school one or two days a week.
              <p class="deets"> The fewer days an ALT is at a particular
                school, the fewer opportunities there are to build relationships with
                students or discuss classes and teaching ideas with other teachers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              There may be <i>no</i> opportunity to discuss lesson plans.
              <p class="deets">
                It's usually preferable to plan classes well ahead. However, if the
                only day to discuss a class is the day <i>of</i> class, the ALT barely
                has any opportunity to ask questions, discuss ideas for activities or
                even suggest improvements.
              </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              The ability to reschedule lessons is very limited.
              <p class="deets">
                It's impossible to reschedule a lesson for a different day the same
                week because the ALT is only there one day a week. This means there
                may be large gaps between lessons more often.
            </li>
          </ul>

          aria-labelledby="size_h" data-bs-parent="#school_a">
          <p>
            In general, classes for learning a foreign language need to be large
            enough to create a fun atmosphere and limit the amount of pressure on each
            individual student. They also need to be large enough to allow pair
            conversation or group work. However, they should be small enough that the
            overall noise doesn't drown out each person speaking and the teacher is
            able to give each student attention and feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most classes in public school are 30~35 students. This is certainly
            large enough to create a fun low-pressure atmosphere... so much so
            that the classes can become very difficult to manage.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some challenges that also exist in smaller classes are compounded.
              <p class="deets">
                Some students demand
                attention and will disrupt the lesson to get it. Others, who also need
                attention but are less vocal, may feel neglected and lose interest. While
                these points are also true in smaller classes, in larger classes it
                becomes far more pronounced when students who cry out for attention have
                to either combine forces or compete with each other to get the attention
                they need. Likewise, the larger number of students who are unwilling to
                ask for help almost guarantees that the teacher will be unable to engage
                each one of them individually to give them the attention they need.
              </p>
              <p class="deets">In short, it's too difficult to stand out from the
                crowd and too easy to disappear into it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              The approach that makes large classes manageable when teaching other
              subjects doesn't work well for English lessons.
              <p class="deets">
                A teacher-centered classroom where students
                face forward and speak only to the teacher only when called upon may be
                the way to create a manageable classroom setting in situations where
                the students are expected to solve problems and retain information.
                However, classes that focus on communication cannot be expected to
                operate effectively in this way.
              </p>
              <p class="deets">There is great potential for developing a student-centered approach.</p>

                if I took on as much of the responsibility for English lessons as
                possible. In reality, I was just depriving them of an opportunity to

            <summary>Each ALT has their own idea of what thier role is and should be.</summary>

            <p class="deets">
              Some ALTs take their role as educators more seriously than the term
              'assistant language teacher' recognizes. They want to do anything they can
              to improve their students' communication skills and be a positive
              influence on their lives.
            </p>
            <p class="deets">
              Some ALTs are are happy to take on a temporary position sharing their
              language and culture with children for a year or two while they enjoy the
              experience of learning a bit about the language and culture of a foreign
              country themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="deets">
              Of course either (and everything in between) is perfectly fine but, each
              ALT must deal with the previous experiences and expectations of staff
              members who have worked with other ALTs.
            </p>
            <p>
              ALTs may face unreasonable expectations of their ability to lead engaging
              and productive lessons in such a challenging situation. Assuming that they
              should be expected to lead the lesson in the first place.</p>
            <p>
              Facing unreasonably low expectations presents a different struggle.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It may be difficult to get their ideas and methods put into practice or even
                try things to find out what works, what doesn't work and why.
              </li>
              <li>
                They may only be asked to flash cards and model pronunciation a few
                times during class.

                <p class="deets">
                  The ALT may spend a lot of the class time just
                  waiting for their cue. It's sometimes difficult to stay engaged in the
                  lesson themselves.
                </p>
                <p class="deets">
                  With the HRT/JTE responsible for setting the pace and flow of the
                  lesson, they will naturally end up modeling some language themselves.
                  Even more so in 5th and 6th grade classes because, for one lesson each
                  week, there is no ALT to ask. It just somes naturally to model the
                  language themselves.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Although it may be appreciated and even encouraged, it's not
                expected that the ALT will develop a meaningful relationship with
                the students.
                <p class="deets">
                  Even if an ALT sticks with the job for more than a year, they are
                  often reassigned to other schools. Homeroom teachers who spend
                  all day every day with their students know their students very
                  well. Even even JTEs who spend two hours a week for a number of
                  years can at least be expected to remember all their students'
                  names. This is not so for ALTs who spend 45 minutes a week with
                  each class of 30+ students for one year (even in classes where
                  the students wear name tags).

            <p>Teaching English as a second language to large groups of small children in
              mixed-level classes is probably the most challenging EFL teaching situation
              there is. Although the job is certainly available to experienced teachers
              and it's preferable to sign ALTs who have gained experience, many of those
              people opt for more lucrative and less strenuous job opportunities.

              'Experience' beyond teaching materials and methodology is important too.

            <p>
              The term 'culture shock' refers to the difficulty of getting used to
              doing and thinking about things differently. Something more akin to culture
              fatigue starts to set in after a few years of getting used to a cluture that
              doesn't seem to be getting used to you.
            </p>
            <p class="deets">
              Many ALTs are just serious enough
              about their work and just experienced enough working in the field that they
              become frustrated with the lack of influence they have on improving their
              own situation and the circumstances for their students.
            </p>
            <p class="deets">
              It is difficult to stay optimistic when you always feel like the new guy, or
              a guest at your workplace. Again, some people are fine with the temporary
              ALT position but others hope to eventually gain a real sense of job security
              and a sense that they are an experienced and valued part of a team.

            <p>Even experienced ALTs
              have to be comfortable following their lead. The ALT may have many
              suggestions regarding the curriculum, materials or pedagogy but it's
              ultimately the JTE who bears responsibility for what the students cover.
              The JTE teaches another entire lesson solo each week, so they will have
              a better idea of where those specific students are and how the class needs
              to be managed.

            <p>ALTs need to be comfortable following the lead of the homeroom teacher
              but I believe they also need to be comfortable leading lessons
              themselves if necessary.

                <p class="deets">
                  Sometimes homeroom teachers get sick and the ALT will already be more
                  prepared than the substitute teacher. English classes could be
                  rescheduled but consistent practice is far better.

                HRTs may have to deal with emergencies.
                <p class="deets">
                  Sometimes homeroom teachers have to deal with emergency situations
                  involving students and you never know when they will happen or how
                  long they will take to resolve.
              </li>
              <li>
                Not all HRTs approach English lessons with the same enthusiasm.
                <p class="deets">
                  The concern has been raised that some homeroom teachers are less
                  interested in doing their job where teaching English is concerned.
                  But consider the fact that teaching English isn't a part of the homeroom
                  teachers job in every city. Many have English specialists teaching 3rd
                  and 4th grade. Tatsuno could opt for this approach but it's a step
                  backward in my opinion.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Some homeroom teachers simply need more assistance than others.
                <p class="deets">
                  If a teacher is willing to lead the class, they certainly should.
                  They may model imperfect pronunciation or make mistakes that a
                  native speaker wouldn't but it's important for students to have a
                  real English-speaking Japanese role model they can look up to.
                </p>
                <p class="deets">
                  However, if a teacher is only going to demonstrate unwillingness to
                  try by saying things like, "I don't speak English" out loud during
                  the lesson, it's better to let someone else lead.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                The ALT gains experience each time they teach the same lesson.
                <p class="deets">
                  Teaching a lesson once gives them an opportunity to make adjustments so
                  that it is smoother, more productive and more fun for subsequent classes.
                  Without this insight, each class has to follow the 'rough draft'.
                  This is a benefit that the English specialists have that could and
                  should be applied to all classes if possible.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                This is the direction English instruction will eventually need to move anyway.
                <p class="deets">
                  It's more efficient for the one person who is going to be present during
                  each lesson to prepare for the lesson rather than each homeroom teacher
                  being more or less prepared and all of them proceeding in different ways
                  because each is more or less willing and more or less able to lead an
                  English lesson to begin with.
                </p>
                <p class="deets">
                  Also, if one person takes responsibility for leading a lesson and
                  another takes responsibility for helping students follow, it's
                  better that the HRT who knows their students and how to deal with
                  them best - who is able to guide and encourage them in their native
                  language be the one helping the students follow along.

            <br />
            Not having the book means not having the materials (cards) included in the
