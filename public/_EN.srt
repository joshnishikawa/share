00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello, this is an attempt to summarize Tatsuno's 
approach to teaching English in elementary school.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,000
The information is based on my experience over 
the past year in the position of an ALT 

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
and my conversations with other ALT's, teachers, 
members of the board of education and parents.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,880
Although I'll be speaking in English, the target audience includes 
all of them and anyone else with an interest in the subject.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,560
Any leaking opinions are mine alone.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:35,760
First of all, I should discuss Tatsuno's approach to teaching English 
in relation to my understanding of how some other cities handle it.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,960
Each city has its own overall approach to teaching English in elementary school.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,240
Some cities have English specialists who are 
responsible for teaching English to third through sixth grades.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,520
Some cities have any combination of home room teachers, English specialists or

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,720
English teachers from junior high schools 
come to teaching English in elementary schools.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,920
This depends on location number of students and availability of staff.

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:11,020
Some cities hire enough ALTs to join each class each week.
Other cities only hire enough ALTs to join each class once or twice a month.

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,360
There are different ALT agencies for cities to choose from.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Each agency has its own hiring standards 
employment benefits and training procedures

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:27,000
But generally the ALT position is considered a temporary position.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,680
This inevitably has some effect on how seriously their role is taken. 
And I'll talk more about this very complicated aspect later.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,000
Different cities have different working relationships with their ALT agencies.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:51,840
Although the English curriculum is determined by the prefecture 
cities that rely more heavily on ALTs may also 

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
rely on their respective agencies for providing 
lesson plans and teacher training.

20
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,720
Some cities also ask ALTs to take on a more 
active role in the classroom than others.

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:09,600
There are even cities that are considering foregoing 
the ALT position all together and hiring native English speakers 
to teach English lessons assisted by the home room teachers.

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
As for Tatsuno...

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,720
The city of Tatsuno covers a large area with schools of all sizes.

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,480
So the teaching situations vary quite a bit.
Generally, third and fourth grade homeroom teachers lead the lessons 
once a week with the ALT assisting each time.

25
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:35,040
Fifth and sixth grade classes have English lessons 
twice a week the first lesson is taught either by an English specialist

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,880
or by the homeroom teacher alone. 
The second is taught by the same person assisted by an ALT.

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,080
The agency that trains and provides ALTs for Tatsuno 
also facilitates training sessions for teachers.

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,320
These sessions are voluntary for homeroom teachers.

29
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,860
However, English specialists are required to attend 
these sessions periodically as well as other training sessions

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,760
facilitated by the city and the prefecture.

31
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,800
I think this is a balanced and relatively progressive approach...in my opinion.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,520
Because every student can interact with 
a native English speaker at least once a week

33
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,200
Homeroom teachers in third and fourth grade make 
great English speaking role models for their students.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
I believe fifth and sixth grade in some schools, too.

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,440
All the students get some English instruction 
exclusively with a Japanese teacher.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,720
Many students need certain things explained thoroughly 
as well as opportunities to ask questions 
without the pressure of being 

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,160
expected to use language  they're not comfortable with yet.
And then they have a second lesson to practice what they've learned.

38
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,240
This has the potential to be very productive and fun.

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,560
And also it is really important to give the students confidence and enthusiasm

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,160
before they enter the junior high school English program.

41
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,480
So with all this being said, it was done a bit differently 
last year and it will be done a bit differently next year as

42
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,000
Tatsuno pushes to unify the curriculum between 
elementary and junior high school.

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
So even within the city of Tatsuno, it does depend on the school and

44
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,760
there are many factors. Among the most significant 
are the number of classes

45
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,760
Each school has a different number of classes 
in each grade and all together.

46
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,160
For large schools planning lessons may be delegated.

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,080
I worked at a large school this year with 
either five or six classes in each grade.

48
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,740
For third and fourth grades. It would be 
impractical to me with each of twelve homeroom tachers

49
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,960
to discuss what to do in class.
Instead one of the homeroom teachers in each grade

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,440
made the lesson plan for all teachers in that grade. 
This is how we kept all classes on the same page.

51
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
However, there are a few problems built into this approach.

52
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Most teachers follow a lesson plan written by someone else.

53
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,800
The teacher who actually makes the lesson plan with the ALT 
knows exactly what to do and when.
Other teachers receive a copy of the lesson plan

54
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,000
but may not understand exactly how to proceed or 
where they're needed to explain or help demonstrate.

55
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,200
Even if it is made clear, there may be several days 
before the plan is used in the classroom.

56
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,440
It's also easy to overlook things that 
need to be prepared before class.

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,160
It is difficult to refine the lesson plan because it's already written.

58
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,600
The ALT gains valuable experience each time they 
teach the lesson and may find something that needs more clarification

59
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,560
or a more fun way to do something and there 
isn't often an opportunity to communicate this 
with the next teacher or teachers.

60
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,320
But doing things off-script may create confusion.

61
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,560
The scheduling and rescheduling of lessons can get very chaotic.

62
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,640
The schedule in elementary school can be very unpredictable.
Even more so with more classes.

63
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,040
Different classes in the same grade are often 
at different points in the curriculum.

64
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,600
This makes it a bit hard to keep track of 
what each class needs to be doing.

65
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,920
There are several smaller schools in Tatsuno 
which face a different set of challenges.

66
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720

67
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,280
The ALT may only be at the school one or two days a week.

68
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,160
The fewer days an ALT is at a particular school,
the fewer opportunities ther are

69
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,280
to build relationships with students or 
discuss classes and teaching ideas with other teachers.

70
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,240
There may be no opportunity to discuss lesson plans. 
It's usually preferable to plan classes well ahead.

71
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,320
However, if the only day to discuss a class is the day of class

72
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,040
the ALT barely has an opportunity to ask questions 
discuss ideas for activities or even suggest improvements.

73
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,080
And the ability to reschedule lessons is very limited.

74
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,800
It's impossible to reschedule a lesson for a different 
day of the same week because the ALT is only at 
that particular school one day a week.

75
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,200
One or two days a week. 
This means there may be large gaps between lessons more often

76
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,520
But beyond just the number of classes,
it also depends on the class size.

77
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,600
This is always an issue in education and especially I think with

78
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,600
second language lessons and classes.

79
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:32,640

80
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:32,680

81
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,720
In general classes for learning a foreign language 
need to be large enough to create a fun atmosphere and

82
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,440
limit the amount of pressure on each individual student. 
They also need to be large enough to allow pair conversation or group work.

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,400
However, they should be small enough that 
the overall noise doesn't drown out each person speaking 
and the teacher is able to give each student attention and feedback.

84
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,080
Most classes in public schools are 30 to 35 students.

85
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:08,080
This is certainly large enough to create a fun low-pressure atmosphere. 
So much so that classes can become very difficult to manage.

86
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,440
Some challenges that also exist in 
smaller classes are compounded in larger classes.

87
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,840
Some students demand attention and will disrupt 
the lesson to get it.

88
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,600
Others who also need attention but are 
less vocal may feel neglected or lose interest.

89
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,120
While these points are also true in smaller classes, in larger classes

90
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,200
it becomes far more pronounced when students 
who cry out for attention have to either 
combine forces or compete with each other

91
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,320
to get the attentions they need.

92
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,880
Likewise, the large number of students who are 
unwilling to ask for help almost guarantees that 

93
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,480
The teacher will be unable to engage each one of them 
individually to give them the attention they need.

94
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,920
But beyond just those who cry out for attention 
and those who sort of want to blend in

95
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:09,240
students generally respond better when they are 
engaged as individuals and not as such a large group.

96
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,400
In short, it's too difficult to stand out 
from the crowd and too easy to disappear into it.

97
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:23,720
The approach that makes large classes manageable 
when teaching other subjects doesn't work well for English lessons.

98
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,240
A teacher-centered classroom where students 
face forward and speak only to the teacher only when called upon

99
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,680
may be the way to create a manageable classroom setting
in situations where the students are expected to 

100
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
solve problems and retain information.

101
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,960
However, classes that focus on communication 
cannot be expected to operate effectively in this way.

102
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,200
There is great potential for developing a student-centered approach.

103
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720

104
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,880
So, even within any school it depends on the grade because

105
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:10,520
the curriculum is handled... the approach the teaching 
is handled differently depending on the grade.

106
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
In third and fourth grade classes,
they are considered an activity.

107
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,280
Classes in these grades are only taught once a week.
The homeroom teacher is considered T1 and leads the lesson.

108
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,080
The ALT follows their lead as T2 
and the students are not graded.

109
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,800
In fifth and sixth grade classes,

110
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,280
they are considered a subject. They're taught twice a week.

111
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,200
And again one is led either by the homeroom teacher 
or an English specialist as T1 without the ALT.

112
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,560
The other lesson has the teacher assisted by the ALT as T2.

113
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,960
Students are required to take listening and conversation tests.

114
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,320
Students' performance in English class is reflected on their report card.

115
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,240

116
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
This may be the most complicated

117
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,440
aspect of this whole presentation.

118
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:13,240
It depends on the homeroom teacher the JTE or English specialist 
the ALT and all of their working relationships.

119
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,360
And before before I get into this I just want to 

120
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,280
emphasize how hard all of these teachers are working 
at their extremely complicated jobs...

121
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,400
extremely complicated and difficult jobs and 
I hope my comments are interpreted with the utmost respect

122
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
for the work they all do.

123
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,360
So with that being said, it does depend on the homeroom teacher.

124
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,400
Some homeroom teachers are more proficient in English 
than others and they'll tell you this themselves.

125
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,600
Some homeroom teachers have enough 
confidence in their English proficiency.

126
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,440
Many people, even teachers, hide their English proficiency.

127
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,360
They may understand English well enough to lead an English lesson

128
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,000
but that doesn't mean they have enough confidence

129
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,160
in their own ability to feel comfortable leading an English lesson.

130
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,960
Some homeroom teachers would just rather leave it to the pros

131
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,440
as it were.

132
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Proficient in English or not, some would simply 
rather leave the English instruction to 
a native speaker or at least someone who specializes in it.

133
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,240
This is how other subjects like music and calligraphy are handled.

134
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,320
And again, homeroom teachers already handle an enormous load.

135
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,200
But then many teachers are quite confident 
and enthusiastic about teaching English.

136
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:45,560
Early on, I made the mistake of assuming that 
everyone would be happy if I took on as much of

137
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
the responsibility for teaching English lessons as possible

138
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:57,320
In reality, I was just depriving those homeroom teachers 
of an opportunity to set a good example for their students 
by taking a more active role in English lessons themselves.

139
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,200
It also, of course, depends on the ALT.

140
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,800
Each ALT has their own idea of what their role is and should be.

141
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,040
Some ALTs take their role as educators more 
seriously than the term assistant language teacher recognizes.

142
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,040
They want to do anything they can to improve 
their students' communication skills and be 
a positive influence on their lives.

143
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Some ALTs are happy to take on a temporary position 
sharing their language and culture with children for a year or two

144
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,040
while they enjoy the experience of learning 
a bit about language and culture of a foreign country themselves.

145
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,880
Of course, either and everything in between is perfectly fine

146
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,720
but each ALT must deal with the previous

147
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,320
experiences and expectations of staff members 
who have worked with other ALTs.

148
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,640
ALTs may face unreasonable

149
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,760
expectations of their ability to lead engaging 
and productive lessons in such a challenging situation.

150
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,680
Assuming that they should be expected 
to lead the lesson in the first place.

151
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,000
But facing unreasonably low expectations 
presents a different struggle.

152
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:19,240
It may be difficult to get their ideas and methods 
put into practice or even try things to find out

153
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
what works, what doesn't doesn't work and why.

154
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,000
They may only be asked to flash cards and 
model pronunciation a few times during class.

155
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,840
The ALT may spend a lot of the class time 
just waiting for their cue.

156
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,840
It's sometimes difficult to stay 
engaged in the lessons themselves.

157
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
With the homeroom teacher and JTE responsible 
for setting the pace and flow of the lesson,

158
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,280
they will naturally end up modeling some 
of the language themselves.

159
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,640
Even more so in fifth and sixth grade classes 
because for one lesson each week there is no ALT.

160
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,880
It just comes naturally to model the language themselves.

161
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,800
Although it may be appreciated and encouraged,

162
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,480
it's not expected that the ALT will develop 
a meaningful relationship with the students.

163
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,320
Even if an ALT sticks with the job for 
more than a year, they're often reassigned to other schools.

164
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,040
Homeroom teachers who spend all day every day 
with their students know their students very well.

165
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,360
And even JTEs who spend two hours a week for a number of years

166
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,400
can at least be expected to remember all their student's names.

167
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,160
This is not so for ALTs who spend 45 minutes a week 
with each class of 30 plus students for one year...

168
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,840
even in classes where the students wear name tags.

169
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,800
It may be difficult to find experienced ALTs 
or to keep those that gain experience.

170
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,520
Teaching English as a second language to 
large groups of small children in 
mixed level classes

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,560
is probably the most challenging 
EFL teaching situation there is.

172
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,960
Although the job is certainly available to 
experienced teachers and it's preferable to 
sign ALTs who have gained experience,

173
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,680
many of those people opt for more lucrative 
and less strenuous job opportunities.

174
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,400
Experience beyond teaching materials 
and methodology is important too.

175
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,320
The term culture shock refers to the difficulty of 
getting used to doing and thinking about things differently.

176
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:33,800
Something more akin to culture fatigue starts 
to set in after a few years of getting used to 
a culture that doesn't seem to be getting used to you.

177
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,200
Many ALTs are just serious enough about their work 
and just experienced enough working in the field

178
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,960
that they become frustrated with the lack of influence 
that they have on improving their own situation 
and the circumstances for their students.

179
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:55,080
It is difficult to stay optimistic when you 
always feel like the new guy or a guest at your workplace.

180
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,720
Again, some people are fine with the temporary ALT position

181
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,240
but others hope to eventually gain a real 
sense of job security and a sense that they're 
an experienced and valued part of a team.

182
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay, and it also depends on the working 
relationship between all the teaching staff...

183
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,360
homeroom teachers, JTEs and ALTs

184
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,960
Due to all the variables discussed thus far 
ALTs must be very flexible

185
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
in their approach to teaching English.

186
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,040
When an English specialist is leading the lesson,

187
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,440
even experienced ALTs have to be comfortable following their lead.

188
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,080
The ALT may have many suggestions regarding

189
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,160
the curriculum, materials or pedagogy but, ultimately,

190
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,400
it's the JTE who bears responsibility for what the students cover.

191
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,200
The JTE teaches another entire lesson solo each week

192
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,240
so they will have a better idea of where those 
specific students are and how the class needs to be managed.

193
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
When the homeroom teacher leads the class, 

194
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,600
ALTs need to be comfortable following the lead of the homeroom teacher.

195
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,120
But, I believe they also need to be comfortable 
leading the lessons themselves if necessary.

196
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,920
Homeroom teachers may be absent unexpectedly.

197
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,560
Sometimes homeroom teachers get sick and the ALT will 
already be more prepared than the substitute teacher.

198
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,520
English classes could be rescheduled, 
but consistent practice is far better

199
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,840
Homeroom teachers may have to deal with emergencies.

200
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,960
Sometimes homeroom teachers have to deal with 
emergency situations involving students

201
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
and you never know when they will happen
or how long they'll take to resolve.

202
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,880
Not all homeroom teachers approach 
English lessons with the same enthusiasm.

203
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:57,480
The concern has been raised that some 
homeroom teachers are less interested in 
doing their job where teaching English is concerned.

204
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,360
But consider the fact that teaching English is 
not a part of the homeroom teacher's job in every city.

205
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,200
And they also trade responsibility for it 
depending on the school.

206
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600

207
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,800

208
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,280
Many cities and schools have English specialists 
teaching third and fourth grade and

209
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,640
Tatsuno could opt for this approach, 
but it's a step backward in my opinion.

210
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,160
Some homeroom teachers simply need more assistance than others.

211
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,200
If a teacher is willing to lead the class, they certainly should;

212
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:44,280
They may model imperfect pronunciation or 
make mistakes that a native speaker wouldn't 
but it's important for students to have a real

213
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,320
English-speaking Japanese role model they can look up to.

214
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,480
However, if a teacher is only going to demonstrate 
unwillingness to try

215
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,680
by saying things like I don't speak English 
out loud during the lesson, it's better to let someone else lead.

216
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,000
The ALT gains experience each time they teach the same lesson

217
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,160
Teaching a lesson once gives them an opportunity to 
make adjustments so that it's smoother, more productive 

218
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,320
and more fun for subsequent classes.
Without this insight each class has to follow the rough draft.

219
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,600
This is a benefit that the English specialists have

220
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
in fifth and sixth grades

221
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,320
that could and should be applied to all classes if possible.

222
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,880
And finally, this is the direction English 
instruction will eventually need to move anyway.

223
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,960
It's more efficient for the one person who's 
going to be present during each lesson to prepare for the lesson

224
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,640
rather than each homeroom teacher being more or less 
prepared and all of them proceeding in different ways

225
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,480
because each is more or less willing and more 
or less able to lead an English lesson to begin with.

226
00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:00,440
Also, if one person takes responsibility for 
leading a lesson and another takes responsibility 
for helping students follow,

227
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,160
it's better that the homeroom teacher who 
knows their students and how to deal with them best...

228
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,240
who's able to guide and encourage them in their 
native language be the one helping the students follow along.

229
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,400
Finally, it depends on familiarity with teaching resources.

230
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,920
All students have a Chromebook they can use.

231
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,520
The level at which they are put to use 
in class varies by the school grade and teacher.

232
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,160
Third and fourth grade classes use the 
"Let's Try" series of textbooks.

233
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,680
These books were introduced in 2011 and 
are published by Hyogo prefecture.

234
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,480
Fifth and sixth grade classes

235
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,600
use the "New Horizon" series of textbooks.

236
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,680
These books are more current and have recently been updated.

237
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,680
The curriculum for teaching English to children 
at the beginner level will basically be the same regardless of

238
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,000
which book is used but the activities, media resources 
and supplementary materials will vary.

239
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,560
The shortcomings of any textbook may include...

240
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,560
Target language that is outdated, not useful or simply incorrect.

241
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Activities that are

242
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
confusing, difficult or just not fun.

243
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,960
Illustrations and media that may be outdated or irrelevant.

244
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
And...

245
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,440
inability to facilitate activities when textbooks go missing.

246
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,920
Students can look at each other's textbooks, 
but they can't write in them.

247
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,920
Teachers have to be able to accommodate students who 
don't have their textbook or they will be left out of

248
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
many listening and writing exercise.

249
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,520
Not having the textbook also means 
not having the materials or cards included in the book.

250
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,760
Teachers will have to improvise to 
make sure students can participate

251
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
in certain conversation activities, too

252
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,320
Some shortcomings of the textbooks currently in use - 

253
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
specifically "Let's Try"...

254
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,440
Numbers to 20 are covered for one month in third grade.

255
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,720
Numbers to 12 are covered for one month in fourth grade.

256
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,200
This is nowhere near enough practice with numbers 
considering they're used for so many things like

257
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
time, dates, money, etc

258
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
The difference between

259
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,880
singular and plural nouns is also covered very briefly.

260
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,640
This is a very important language point 
in English, but it can be confusing.

261
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,120
The textbook covers it so briefly that 
teachers may skip it entirely.

262
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,760
Certain activities or examples are not level-appropriate.
Teachers have no choice, but to skip them entirely.

263
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640

264
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,920

265
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,200
Otherwise, only letter names are taught.

266
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,960
Phonetic sounds, reading and writing are 
barely touched on even in fourth grade.

267
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,880
On one hand teachers may feel like they're not doing
their job if they don't follow the textbook closely enough.

268
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:09,080
On the other hand, they may feel guilty brushing over 
or skipping things covered in the textbook that seem 
too confusing or irrelevant.

269
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,000
And this is where ALTs have a lot to offer

270
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
among other things.

271
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,960
While it's important for all students to be 
exposed to the same basic target language and 
that language should follow some logical progression,

272
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,760
A textbook is just one tool at the teacher's disposal.

273
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,800
Teachers must make use of any and all tools at 
their disposal to facilitate the most engaging 
and productive lessons possible.

274
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,920
ALTs can help.

275
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,160
They can help provide valuable insight into authentic English usage.

276
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,960
They can introduce more current or more useful vocabulary and phrases.

277
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,560
They can help make the most of the textbook 
and all other available resources.

278
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,280
They can help develop more relevant and engaging 
activities or methods to make lessons more 
interesting and productive.

279
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,480
They can share interesting aspects of their culture 
and ask students about theirs.

280
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
And of course model pronunciation.

281
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I hope I've provided some understanding of how

282
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,080

283
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,760
complicated an issue teaching English and 
elementary schools is and how much effort it takes

284
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:29,480
from ALTs, teachers and the Board of Education 
to make the most of limited class time and resources 
and help students get the most out of that effort.

285
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,960
I haven't even touched on many other challenges 
like the language barrier between teachers and ALTs,

286
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:46,600
differences not only in culture, but personality and 
students with special needs, students to get themselves 
stuck in the I don't speak English category and

287
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,960
students who are very very keen to learn English 
until it comes to speaking.

288
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,680
There is a lot I've left out, but I've tried to be thorough.

289
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
I've also tried to be more

290
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,560
constructive than critical and, although 
I've probably missed that mark a few times,

291
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,400
I hope anyone who's come across this 
has gained at least some insight and

292
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,360
I look forward to gaining further insight myself as time goes on. Thank you!
