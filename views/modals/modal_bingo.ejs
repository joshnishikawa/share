        <p>Have the students choose a random selection of words on the screen 
          and write them on a sheet of paper in a grid. Have them use a...
          <ul>
            <li>5x5 grid if there are at least 25 words</li>
            <li>4x4 grid if there are at least 16 words</li>
            <li>3x3 grid if there are at least 9 words</li>
          </ul>
          Then click start. The words will appear in random order. Use the
          navigation buttons or &larr; &rarr; to navigate through the 
          words/images. The students find and circle the ones they chose. The 
          first student to cross off all the words in a row wins.
