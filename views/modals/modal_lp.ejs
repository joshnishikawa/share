  This is a simple outline for a team-teaching lesson plan. It's meant to
  privide a very basic structure for a lesson that is taught by two teachers so
  that everyone knows, at a glance, what they are supposed to be doing at any
  given time. The idea is to keep the lesson moving smoothly and to keep the
  students engaged.
