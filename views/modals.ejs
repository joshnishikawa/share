          <li>Pro Tip 1: Some decks are sorted into pairs. Sort them alphabetically by 
          unchecking "Shuffle" when the deck is selected.</li>
          <li>Pro Tip 2: Some decks are large. Cherry pick a review deck before your
          students see them. You could even have multiple tabs set up.</li>

        This is simply a set of images take from the A-GO brain box. 
        The cards are too small for more than one person to see at a time so
        this is a way to let the whole class see what you're talking about.

        Students can study numbers by calling out the colors on the backs of the number cards.
        Then colored numbers appear on the backs of the animal cards.
        Once they've learned the animals, they can study letters by calling out 
        the two animals that start with each letter.
        Other letters are covered with simple objects.
        They can then study shapes by calling out more colors.
        Colored shapes will become the backs of the next sets.
