        <p>Choose a number of cards to hide.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You could choose only a few to hide and ask "What's missing?"</li>
            <li>You could hide them all to see how many the class can remember.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Click <strong>START</strong>. A search bar and the images (flipped or 
          not) will appear in a grid. Students will call out words and you type
          them into the search bar. As you type, all words that match the input
          will be highlighted. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> at any time to flip
          highlighted cards. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You could have students call out one letter and flip all cards
              that begin with that letter.</li>
            <li>You could have students give you words, type them in and flip them one at a time.</li>
            <li>You could have students spell out the word at least until only 
              one is highlighted.</li>
            <li>You could have students spell out the whole word themselves and,
              if it's still highlighted when they finish, it's correct. Flip it!</li>

          <strong>NOTE:</strong> If the students need a hint you can either...
          <ul>
            <li>Click on an individual image to flip it until you release the 
              mouese button.</li>
            <li>Press the <kbd>?/</kbd> button to peek at all highlighted cards 
              (if any) or to peek at all unflipped cards (if none are 
              highlighted). Cards will remain visible until you release the button.

          </ul>

        <hr/>
        <p class="small">I'm not sure how to handle words that start with other 
          words yet. For example, If someone says "rice", both 'rice' and 
          'rice ball' will be highlighted since they both begin with 'rice'.</p>
