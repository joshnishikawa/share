          students see them. You could even have multiple tabs set up.</li>

        Students can study numbers by calling out the colors on the backs of the number cards.
        Then colored numbers appear on the backs of the animal cards.
        Once they've learned the animals, they can study letters by calling out 
        the two animals that start with each letter.
        Other letters are covered with simple objects.
        They can then study shapes by calling out more colors.
        Colored shapes will become the backs of the next sets.
